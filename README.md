# Rhode Island School Mobility

ARTG6900 Visualization Technologies II final project, Rachel Peterson



## Summary

Changing schools midyear disrupts curriculum, expectations, and relationships for students. These changes can have long-term impact on student learning.

Rhode Island publishes school-level mobility and stability data each year, but doesn't do much with it beyond that. Mobility and stability rates are two ways to report on student flow during the school year, both focusing on midyear changes, students changing schools between Oct. 1 and June 1. A school's mobility rate is defined as the sum of students entering and exiting midyear divided by the average number of students enrolled on a given day in the school year. A school's stability rate (not examined in this visualizaiton) is defined as out of all students enrolled at some point, the percentage who were continuously enrolled from Oct. 1 through June 1.

I thought of doing this when I was cleaning student data and noticed a number of students who had attened 9+ schools over their time in the Rhode Island school system. That lack of consistency shocked me. If we knew how students were moving (between schools within a district versus out of district, etc), maybe we could shape policy to better support mobile students.

The network graph provides information on schools and districts relationships with each other (rather than as individual rates), and geographic context for school mobility. The stream graph provides an additional aggregation between out-of-state, out-of-district and in-district transfers as well as data over time. These 3 types of transfers show us the scope needed to consider addressing school mobility.

I got permisison from our director of Data and Technology Services to aggregate our individual level enrollment data to get the connections between schools, rather than only one school level rate, for this project.



## Extensions
    
The key next step I would take is incorporating student dmeographics and performance. This visualization requires local knowledge of Rhode Island schools to be very useful. Providing more context would make it accessible to additional users who may be interested in overall mobility trends rather than specific school to school interactions.

A larger extension would be to also consider the impact of mobility on students. Here I report out information on mobility, but take for granted that it impacts student learning. This would be a significant research project.

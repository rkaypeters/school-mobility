My next steps (I think) as of 4/7:
    4. reconsider visual elements; this is a good point for design considerations (color for source v target for filters? whats the best way to show the strength of these relationships? where should the 190s and 000s go?, etc). this needs work.
        a. color systems and highlighting
        b. consider altering weight of links to match percentage of students rather than count
        c. title and whatnot
        d. css
        done - e. consider repsentation of overall mobility rate in a channel in this chart 
        f. improve labelling
    DONE - 5. streamgraph of students by school over time
    6. school information (mobility and stability rate, % economicaly disadvantaged, english learners, nonwhite, proficiency, etc; consider what makes sense)
    mostly done - 7. fix data errors on comses chools and districts
    DONE - 8. check funky geocoding
    DONE - 9. adjust zoom/panning
    DONE - 10. add option to return to full state.

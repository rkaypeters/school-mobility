My next steps (I think) as of 4/7:
    4. reconsider visual elements; this is a good point for design considerations (color for source v target for filters? whats the best way to show the strength of these relationships? where should the 190s and 000s go?, etc). this needs work.
        a. color systems and highlighting
        b. consider altering weight of links to match percentage of students rather than count
        c. title and whatnot
        d. css
        e. consider repsentation of overall mobility rate in a channel in this chart 
        f. improve labelling
    5. streamgraph of students by school over time
    6. school information (mobility and stability rate, % economicaly disadvantaged, english learners, nonwhite, proficiency, etc; consider what makes sense)
    7. fix data errors on comses chools and districts
    8. check funky geocoding
    9. adjust zoom/panning
    10. add option to return to full state.
    11. (optional if time) - try panning and zooming user features on map. d3 has funcationality such that users can move around if I want to go that way
